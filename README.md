Plasma minimal viable protocol:
https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-viable-plasma/426

Implements a Truebit task for processing a batch of transactions in the child chain, and a Solidity contract that manages the Plasma side in Ethereum.

Completely untested.
Also there of course would have to be all kinds of clients that will take care of the chain availability, and prevent bad exits.
